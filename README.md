## Overview

This project aims to search for profiles looking for information such as status, name, etc.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Search for GitHub users by their username
-   See relevant user information based on their search
-   Switch between light and dark themes
-   **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

I'm pretty confident in using APIs, so I ended up coming across HTML and CSS. The class with the JS teacher gave a review using API and I was able to see what an API is and I was really excited about doing a project with API. I studied IoT at college and how it works, in addition to reading about web architecture and web services, they are already starting to have a "system" and that's really cool.

So I took the preview photo and put it in the AI ​​and asked it to create the skeleton of the site. It did it but it wasn't ideal for the layout. I would have to do a lot of CSS, so I fixed the skeleton. The CSS was what took the most work (and it lasted). The SVGs were interfering with my browser. I didn't want to style them using JS, so I chose to get them from the web. The JS was easy, even though I wasn't used to the fetch method, I did it anyway with some expertise. My goal was to quickly do what was missing after using the API so I could move on to the next project.

The only thing is that the profile website link wasn't in the REST API I was working on, so I put the profile link where I found it most convenient.

We also have the option to change the color of the themes, where it searches for the browser theme. I haven't tested if it works yet, but I read the code and it said it did that. The theme changes are working.

I can't identify which aspects I'm using inside myself when I'm coding (when it's too quiet, I end up putting on some music to have something in the background, or even if the background doesn't flow well, I put on some music to try to improve it). As I said, I don't know which aspects I'm practicing when I'm coding. I'm reading Flusser's book (he covers a bit of the history/concept/philosophies of the IT area, mainly human systems and analogies with our world with functionalities).

### Continued development

I intend to do more projects with APIs with more intuitive designs.
